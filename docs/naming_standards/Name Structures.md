# Name Structures

Naming Structures follow this heuristic:

(Sub\_Set\_\_ Feature\_\_ Size\_\_cColor)



Sub\_Set indicates the sub material name :  AluminiumPanels\_Brushed\_1x1\_cWineRed



Feature focuses on a surface feature or style present on the sub material:  CorrugatedPanels\_Classic\_1x3\_cSilverGrey



Size can represent the measurement of a single piece of panel / cladding or give measurement to the overall texture that is found on the sub material: CeramicTiles\_RidgesSmall\_0.5x0.5\_cOcreBrown

&nbsp;

cColor does two things.  Color gives a name to the object color based on RAL (Reichs-Ausschuß für Lieferbedingungen und Gütesicherung) color chart names.  A small c at the front of this will mean the sub material will be colorizable later (think multiply or potentially other blending modes ):      Plaster\_Rough\_10x10\_cAntiquePink
