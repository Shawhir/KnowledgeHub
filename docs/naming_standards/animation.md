# Standardizing Material Directories in Esri.lib

Since the Materials Library is on Esri.lib, it involves the maintenance of existing textures and the creation of new additions.  For the materials to run well on the Library and to be accessible through cga, a consistent set of structures have been provided in the following pages.  The breakdown is as follows:



* &nbsp;	Directory Structures based on Material Type
* &nbsp;	Folder Structures
* &nbsp;	.cgamat Name Structures
* &nbsp;	Texture Name Structures
* &nbsp;	On the Esri.lib (without source)



This guide on Material Directories will provide clarity on how to name new files to adhere to a standard.  This will help not only with the uploading and control of materials in existing rules, but make it possible to add the file to bespoke cga, work within QA Workflows and help create a consistency that continues into 3D Assets.
