# Standardizing Material Naming of files and Directories in Esri.lib

With the Materials Library on Esri.lib, the creation of new additions will be required.  For the materials to run correctly, a consistent set of structures should be adhered to.  The areas of interest are as follows:



* &nbsp;	Directory Structures based on Material Type
* &nbsp;	Folder Structures
* &nbsp;	.cgamat Name Structures
* &nbsp;	Texture Name Structures
* &nbsp;	On the Esri.lib (without source)



This guide will provide clarity on naming new files and directories that adhere to this standard.  This helps with the uploading of new materials to rules, supports Automated QA Workflows and help maintain consistency between files.
