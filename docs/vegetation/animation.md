# Animation (Beta)

* As we progress another element that we are considering to include on
  the models will involve animation.
* Animation has already been experimented with on 3D symbols – focusing
  on their transform values and not their blend shapes.
* If animation was to be included – it would primarily involve setting
  up pivot points for the appropriate groups and animating their
  transformations. This would go hand in hand with setting up their
  groups and giving some thought as to what types of glb groups would
  likely be animated and which would be static.
* Consideration would also have to be given as to what form of animation
  would be strongest on a particular model type. Vegetation would
  generally animate best with an animated vertex shader. ,  it could be considered to use Blend Shapes that interact with the model’s associated bones.
