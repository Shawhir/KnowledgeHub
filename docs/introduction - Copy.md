# Introduction

At ESRI we pride ourselves in high quality work and ever improving our
workflows. A large part of client facing work are our wide range of 3D
glb assets. **As we are improving our 3D models with PBR Shaders
alongside the potential set ups for editing specific mesh groups and
animation; alignment between teams is necessary**. This global alignment
will for example - communicate and consolidate the importance in
consistency of **model and material names, the types of textures made
for PBR Shader, as well as their dimensions and how to approach the
making of UV textures for these types of models.**

This general specification should be used as a guide when creating and
preparing any glb models so they just don’t look great, but if needs be,
they can be **built using a pipeline that is consistent allowing the
models to be accessed through different code or interfaces for editing
in a reliable way.**
