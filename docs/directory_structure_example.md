# Directory structure example

Directory structures (further specified by category) are used as a
simple and effective way to navigate through the created models. Though
the files are stored on the repository, they will be accessible on the
ESRI.lib on CityEngine. A similar structure between the two is required
and this can begin with the artists and designers working on the models:

- When placing the files into directories the files should be easy to
  access, to read and follow along with - not only with the human eye
  but through code and script also.

- Though these assets will be used in SV, Unreal and CE – how they are
  read and accessed in one – may not be interchangeable with the other.

- For Web – tags injected in the glTF metadata are the way to go and
  will be handled by our developers.

- For CE and for storing the models in the repository a separate
  directory structure is needed. We can simply base this on the current
  version.
