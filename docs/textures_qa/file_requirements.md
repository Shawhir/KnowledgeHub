# File Requirements



Since textures are something that must be look their best on a multitude of platforms that are sometimes limited by the device they are displayed on, consideration to visual quality and con-trol must be maintained and controlled for all materials as a heuristic.







<div style="text-align: center;">

&nbsp; <img src="../../images/image57.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />

</div>





In some circumstances – the heuristic may not need to be so rigid if the same quality can be gained for less (using a roughness factor value instead of roughnessmap).  This will overall mean preparing for  better performance on the most limited devices used whilst being forward facing to improvements in memory management and rendering.
