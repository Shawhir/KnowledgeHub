# Purpose

<div style="text-align: center;">

To establish consistent standards and workflows for building, controlling, and reviewing materials across a multitude of platforms. This guide addresses naming conventions, file organization, sizing requirements, quality control procedures, and review processes to ensure consistency and efficiency.

# Context

Already, time and attention have been given so the naming of files/directories easily readable and accessible to Stakeholders and users.  This meant the main directory has been designed with other Architectural Material Libraries (Rhino / Arroway/ Sub-stance) used as a loose reference. It is set up to be future ready and is prepared to hold more materials in the future.  This pushes the need for maintaining and upholding a standard, but something reasonable and made easier where possible.  Also, for each material, there is a complimentary Source folder.  This is used for storing data (psd,max,ai,jpeg) in its most editable form for future use, but will not be accessible in Esri.lib via CE for the users.
These Materials appear in the Material Browser, meaning they are plug in and play once it the Main Directory. Their sizes and textures are balanced for a range of platforms, prepped in .cgamat and are of a high quality.
In the naming convention for the materials, cColorizable prepares these textures to be more versatile in the future through Blending Modes (Multiply, Hard Light etc.) meaning no need to add or delete cgamats, these files will be saved over instead, giving smoother transition for the user when implemented.
